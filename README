XML-FXN version 0.01
====================

XML is used more and more in specifications like BPEL 
as a notation for programming tasks. There is a need for a XML 
notation, which can help handle XML in text mode in a manner 
similar to 'normal' programming languages. Fast XML 
Transformation applies only to well-formed XML documents and 
should allow 1:1 transformation in both directions 
without any loss in the content meaning and editorial structure.
The transformation is based on shallow XML parsing.
